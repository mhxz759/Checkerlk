# index-php-mult-api

## Overview

This is a web-based multi-API checker application that provides a unified interface for testing and validating various API endpoints. The application features a modern, gradient-based UI with a card-based layout system, designed to handle multiple API checking functionalities in a single dashboard. The project uses vanilla PHP for backend processing and Bootstrap-like CSS framework for frontend presentation.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Design Pattern: Component-Based Card Layout**
- The UI is structured around reusable card components that display different API checker functionalities
- Each checker is presented as a separate card with consistent styling and behavior
- Uses a gradient-based modern design system with glassmorphism effects (backdrop-filter blur)

**Styling Approach:**
- Custom CSS with utility classes for rapid UI development
- Gradient backgrounds (purple-blue theme: #667eea to #764ba2)
- Card-based components with semi-transparent backgrounds (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95))
- Nucleo Icons font integration for iconography
- Responsive flexbox-based layout system

**Key UI Components:**
- Checker header with logo and title display
- Button groups with flexible wrapping for action buttons
- Utility classes for spacing, alignment, and text styling (similar to Bootstrap patterns)

### Backend Architecture

**Technology Stack: PHP**
- Server-side processing using vanilla PHP (no framework indicated)
- Likely uses procedural or simple object-oriented PHP for API interactions
- Multiple API integration handlers (implied by "mult-api" in the project name)

**Rationale:**
- PHP chosen for simplicity and ease of deployment
- No complex framework overhead needed for API checking tasks
- Direct HTTP client usage for API requests

### Data Storage

**Current State: No database layer detected**
- Application appears to be stateless
- No schema files or database configuration present
- API checks are likely performed in real-time without persistent storage

**Potential Enhancement:**
- Could add database layer for logging API check results
- User session management if authentication is added
- Historical data tracking for API response times

### Authentication & Authorization

**Current State: No authentication system present**
- Public-facing API checker tool
- No user management or access control detected

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party Libraries

**Frontend:**
- **Poppins Font (Google Fonts)**: Referenced in CSS for typography
- **Nucleo Icons**: Icon font family for UI elements
- **Bootstrap-like Utilities**: Custom implementation of common utility classes

### API Integrations

**Multi-API Support:**
- Application is designed to interact with multiple external APIs (specific APIs not detailed in provided files)
- Likely includes API key management and request formatting for various service providers
- Response parsing and validation for different API formats

### Assets & Resources

**Custom Assets:**
- Nucleo Icons font files (.eot, .woff2, .woff, .ttf, .svg)
- Custom CSS styling system
- Logo images for header display

**Note:** The repository structure suggests additional PHP files exist that handle the actual API checking logic, but they were not included in the provided contents.
